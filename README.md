# cesium-vr

A plugin for [Cesium WebGL Virtual Globe](http://cesiumjs.org) to
support VR devices using a VR-enabled browser. This fork updates
cesium-vr to the latest CesiumJS version and uses
[WebXR](https://immersiveweb.dev/) which is the currently best
standard/proposal for the integration of VR devices for the web.

cesium-vr comes with a demo that exemplifies how to use cesium-vr:

The source code of the demo resides in
[htdocs/index.js](htdocs/index.js)

## Usage

Please note that WebXR API specifies the restriction of not being
present in the browser unless the web page is loaded through `https`
or from `localhost`. This applies for both tethered and standalone
setups.

Check [WebXR's support table](https://immersiveweb.dev/#supporttable)
for a list of supporting web clients.

### PC-VR (Tethered HMD or no HMD)

For Valve Index, HTC Vive Cosmos/Pro, HP Reverb, Varjo, [etc](https://vr-compare.com/pcpowered).

- Run a [WebXR-enabled browser](https://caniuse.com/webxr).
  - In the case of Firefox, you have to activate the
    `dom.vr.webxr.enabled` flag in `about:config`
- Check the [WebXR Sample Pages](https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr-samples/) 
  to check if your browser is WebXR-ready.

  If you have no HMD a good option for development is to install a
  WebXR Emulator extension.

  - **Google Chrome**:
    - Mozilla Mixed Reality's [WebXR API Emulator](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webxr-api-emulator/mjddjgeghkdijejnciaefnkjmkafnnje)
    - Meta's [Immersive Web Emulator](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/immersive-web-emulator/cgffilbpcibhmcfbgggfhfolhkfbhmik)
  - **Mozilla Firefox**:
    - Mozilla Mixed Reality's [WebXR API Emulator](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/webxr-api-emulator/)
  - **Microsoft Edge**:
    - Meta's [Immersive Web Emulator](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/immersive-web-emulator/hhlkbhldhffpeibcfggfndbkfohndamj)

### Standalone HMD

For Oculus/Meta Quest, Pico, HTC Vive Focus, [etc](https://vr-compare.com/standalone).

- **Option 1**: use http to localhost with [reverse port forwarding](https://medium.com/@lazerwalker/how-to-easily-test-your-webvr-and-webxr-projects-locally-on-your-oculus-quest-eec26a03b7ee).

  No need for https certificate generation, but HMD must be used
  connected to the computer through USB to reach the http server.

  - Enable Developer Mode in your headset.
  - Connect to a host PC through USB
  - Install `adb` in the host (Debian Linux: `apt install adb`)
	- If you have [SideQuest](https://sidequestvr.com/) up and
      running, you can use that to issue the `adb reverse` command
      and skip the manual adb setup.
  - From a terminal in the host, run `adb devices`
	- Linux: If adb complaints about udev rules, you may need to create (as
      `root`) the file `/lib/udev/rules/52-hmd.rules` with the
      content:

	```
	SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="2833", ATTR{idProduct}=="0186", MODE="0660", GROUP="plugdev", TAG+="uaccess", SYMLINK+="ocuquest%n", ENV{adb_user}="yes"
	```

	- `idVendor`/`idProduct` may vary, check with `lsusb` and adjust
      accordingly.
	- Then to make the changes effective to the udev subsystem, run:
	
	```
	sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
	sudo udevadm trigger	
	```
	
	- Make sure your user belongs to the group `plugdev` (run `id` to
      check) or whatever permissions your distro requires for you to
      use adb (`plugdev` in Debian allows members to mount USB mass
      storage devices and other removable media).

  - Authorize computer on HMD.
  - Set up reverse forwarding through adb (`adb reverse tcp:8080 tcp:8080`)
	- This may have to be reissued between sessions.
  - Run HMD's web browser

- **Option 2**: Run the http server with https (ssl) enabled.
  - Can be used over WiFi
  - You have to [create a self-signed
    certificate](https://wiki.debian.org/Self-Signed_Certificate) or
    if that won't work, use [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)
    to generate legit certificates for free, but you may have to pay
    for a host or spoof the HMD's DNS system.

### Final steps for both PC-VR and Stand-alone

- Run a local http server from the project root directory, e.g. with
  node.js http-server

    ```
	sudo apt install node-http-server
    cd cesium-vr/htdocs
	ln -s ../src src
    http-server
    ```
	
	OR use the included python3 server:
	
	```
	cd cesium-vr
	python3 server.py
	```

- Using your browser, visit `http://localhost:8080/` (or `https://localhost:4443/`).

### Interaction

- Hit `Enter` to make the browser fullscreen and enter VR mode.
- The mouse can be used on the left eye to navigate.  Number keys take
  you to some pre-set locations. Hit `L` at any time to level the
  camera to the globe surface.
- The `WASD` keys allow horizontal movement with `Q` and `E` allowing
  vertical movement. Holding `Shift` speeds up all movement.

If you are having any problems, visit the [WebXR Sample
Pages](https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr-samples/) to check you
have correctly configured your VR device for use in your browser. If
you're still having troubles, feel free to post an issue on the GitHub
repository.

## Testing

*Note: obsolete info*

At time of writing we have tested **cesium-vr** with Cesium 1.10 in
Firefox Nightly 41.0a1 (2015-05-13) on Windows and OSX using the
Oculus Rift Development Kit 2 and Oculus Runtime 0.5.0.1.  Stereo
rendering should work on other platforms but WebVR may not.

## About

### Stereo Rendering

To render stereo images within Cesium using a single scene and dual
canvases the workflow is as follows.

For each frame:

* Set scene and camera parameters for right eye.
* Render into left eye canvas.
* Canvas copy from left eye canvas to right eye canvas.
* Set scene and camera parameters for left eye.
* Render into left eye canvas.

### Frustum offsetting

We have applied a small modification to Cesium's PerspectiveFrustum
class.  This allows us to apply the required frustum offset e.g. so
the standard globe doesn't render in the center of each canvas. These
modifications are currently being patched into Cesium by replacing the
cameras frustum object with our implementation.
